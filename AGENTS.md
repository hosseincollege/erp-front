# 🤖 ERP Pro - System Architecture & AI Agent Guidelines

You are the Lead Full-Stack Architect for this ERP Pro system (Next.js 15 App Router + NestJS + Prisma + PostgreSQL).
Your job is to think proactively, plan features, write robust modular code, and maintain system consistency.

## 🏗️ 1. Architecture Rules & Conventions

### Preserve the application shell
- Keep the existing `AppShell`, `TopHeader`, sidebar structure, module navigation, and page frame intact unless the user explicitly asks for a specific structural change.
- Treat each module's main destination (`href`) as its landing/overview page. Keep its submenu focused on distinct workflows and resources; never duplicate that landing page as an "Overview" submenu item. Put useful overview content on the module landing page itself, and keep submenu entries separate only when they represent genuinely distinct tasks. Apply this rule consistently across every module.
- Improve settings and module page contents within the current shell; global preferences must be additive and preserve responsive behavior.
- Persian and RTL remain the default. Apply English/LTR only when the user selects English.

### Frontend (Next.js App Router):
- **Layout Persistence:** All authenticated pages live under `src/app/(workspace)/`. Never re-instantiate `AppShell` inside child page components to prevent sidebar flickering/state resets.
- **RTL & Persian UI:** The app is strictly Persian RTL with Tailwind CSS (`dir="rtl"`, Vazirmatn font).
- **State Management:** Use the database as the source of truth for authenticated per-user locale, accent color, and light/dark contrast preferences. Load them through the shared preferences provider on startup/login and save through the authenticated preferences API. Local storage may be a hydration cache only; theme mode and ephemeral UI state may use local storage with hydration guards.
- **Internationalization:** Keep the supported locale registry and locale metadata in `src/lib/languages/index.ts`, with one complete translation dictionary per locale in `src/lib/languages/messages/<locale>.ts`; use `src/lib/ui-messages.ts` as the shared lookup entry point. Add or remove a language through the registry and its locale file. Persian and Arabic use RTL; other supported locales use LTR. Every new or edited user-facing string must have translations for all supported locales; use the shared localization layer instead of component-level language conditionals.
- **Localization workflow:** Every feature that adds or changes user-facing text or variables must update the matching shared translation keys in all ten locale files (`fa`, `en`, `ar`, `zh-CN`, `fr`, `es`, `de`, `ru`, `ja`, `pt-BR`). Keep keys aligned and include the locales/files updated in the completion report.
- **RTL/LTR workflow:** Design every page and component for both directions. Read the selected locale direction from the shared preferences/locale registry, apply it to the page, prefer logical CSS utilities (`text-start`, `start/end`, `ms/me`, `ps/pe`) instead of physical left/right positioning, and explicitly use LTR for technical identifiers when appropriate.
- **Accent preview:** Preview unsaved accent colors only inside the authenticated ERP shell; restore the persisted accent when leaving settings without saving. Keep public landing and login pages on the default blue brand color.
- **Contrast preferences:** Keep independent saved light and dark contrast levels in the authenticated shell. Preview changes in settings and persist them only through the explicit save action.
- **Shell accent consistency:** Use `--primary`, `--primary-soft`, and `--primary-hover` for accents in the authenticated header, sidebar, and dashboard; do not hardcode blue utility colors for shell accents.
- **Organization logo:** The saved header logo shadow is one of `NONE`, `DARK`, or `LIGHT` (white). Keep settings, API, import/export data, and header behavior aligned; do not add a surrounding frame.
- **Top header hover:** Hovering the first two navigation control icons or the account capsule must not change their colors. Preserve their existing active-state accent styling.
- **Notifications foundation:** Use the shared authenticated notifications service and database records for notifications; each record is scoped to its organization and recipient and carries per-user read state. All modules must publish notifications through `NotificationsService.createForUser` with localized title/body values for all ten supported locales, a stable source/event key, and an internal destination when applicable. Keep unread counts and read history in sync between the header bell, notification inbox, and dashboard summary. Do not create module-specific notification stores or use local storage as notification history.

### Backend (NestJS + Prisma):
- **Modular Design:** Every feature has its own Module, Controller, Service, and DTOs with `class-validator`.
- **RBAC & Auth:** Every route must be protected with `@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, RolesGuard)` unless marked `@Public()`.
- **Database:** Prisma multi-file schema (`prisma/schema/*.prisma`). Never break relational integrity.

## 🎯 2. Autonomous Workflow (How AI must think & work)

Whenever assigned a task:
1. **Analyze First:** Check existing Prisma models and frontend routes before writing code.
2. **Plan Steps:** Output a quick 3-to-4 step checklist before code implementation.
3. **Execute End-to-End:** 
   - Step A: DTOs & Service in NestJS.
   - Step B: Controller endpoints.
   - Step C: Frontend API Client in `src/lib/`.
   - Step D: UI Page in `src/app/(workspace)/`.
4. **Self-Review:** Ensure no memory leaks, hydration errors, or layout re-mountings.
